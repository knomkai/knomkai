## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey! My name is **Kanyakorn Khuwiriya**. I'm a first-year Software Engineering student who has just embarked on an exciting coding journey. Even though I'm just starting out, I'm passionate about learning and growing every single day!

- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into **Python** by taking on the **"100 Days of Code"** challenge on Udemy.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate and connect with fellow learners. If you're also on a learning journey, let's grow together!
- 🤔 I'm open to all advice! I know I have a long way to go, so any tips from anyone (and any species on this planet) are greatly appreciated. 😄
- 📫 You can reach me at: **23091999kun@gmail.com**
